# Herd Immunity Bot

A rather simple project I made to calculate the percentage of the population who have developed
![herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) to COVID-19. The info is displayed
by a Twitter bot (link soon) and a ![website](https://vaccination.isawesome.ml).

## Using

Either go to the website or Twitter linked above.

## Running

1. Git clone the project
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python main.py`

## Contributing

If you have ideas for developing this further, just make a PR.

## Roadmap

1. Make it display stuff
